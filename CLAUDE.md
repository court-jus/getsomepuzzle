# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Behaviour rules

### Rule 1 - Think Before Coding

State assumptions explicitly. Ask rather than guess.
Push back when a simpler approach exists.
Stop when confused.

### Rule 2 - Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem.
Nothing speculative.
No abstractions for single-use code.

### Rule 3 - Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Don't improve adjacent code.
Match existing style. Don't refactor what isn't broken.

### Rule 4 - Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Strong success critera let Claude loop independently.

### Rule 5 - Use the model only for judgment calls

Use for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use for : routing, retries, status-code handling, deterministic transformes.
If code can answer, code answers.

### Rule 6 - Surface conflicts, don't average them

If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup if relevant.
Don't blend conflicting patterns.

### Rule 7 - Read before you write

Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
If unsure why existing code is structured a certain way, ask.

### Rule 8 - Checkpoint after every significant step

Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.
If you lose track, stop and restate.

### Rule 9 - Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree

Inside the codebase, Conformance > Taste.
If you think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork it silently.

### Rule 10 - Fail loud

"Completed" is not the same as "succeeded".
If anything was skipped silently, don't consider the task as completed.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.

## Project Overview

Get Some Puzzle is a cross-platform grid-based logic puzzle game built with Flutter (Dart). Players color cells black or white according to constraint rules (forbidden patterns, shapes, group sizes, parity, letter groups, quantity, symmetry, different-from, column count, group count, neighbor count, eyes, row count).

## Architecture

### Flutter App (`lib/`)

- **`main.dart`** — App root and main game state (`_MyHomePageState`). Manages puzzle lifecycle, periodic stats saving (60s interval), optional network telemetry, and locale support (en/es/fr).
- **`getsomepuzzle/`** — Core game logic:
  - `model/puzzle.dart` — `Puzzle` class (grid state, constraint checking, hint system via `findAMove()`), `PuzzleData`
  - `model/database.dart` — `Database` class loads puzzles from `assets/default.txt`, `assets/tutorial.txt`, and local `custom.txt`, handles filtering (`Filters`), playlist management, and stats persistence
  - `model/game_model.dart` — Top-level game state shared by widgets
  - `model/stats.dart` — `Stats` class for per-puzzle timings and rating data
  - `model/settings.dart` — User preferences with enums: `ValidateType`, `ShowRating`, `ShareData`, `LiveCheckType`
  - `model/cell.dart`, `model/constants.dart` — Small shared types
  - `constraints/constraint.dart` — Base `Constraint` and `CellsCentricConstraint` classes
  - `constraints/` — Implementations: `groups.dart`, `parity.dart`, `symmetry.dart`, `motif.dart`, `quantity.dart`, `shape.dart`, `column_count.dart`, `group_count.dart`, `neighbor_count.dart`, `different_from.dart`, `eyes_constraint.dart`. The `registry.dart` maps slugs (`FM`, `PA`, `GS`, `LT`, `QA`, `SY`, `DF`, `CC`, `GC`, `NC`, `EY`) to constraint classes; `to_flutter.dart` maps constraint instances to their rendering widget.
  - `generator/generator.dart` — In-app puzzle generator
  - `generator/worker.dart` (+ `worker_io.dart`/`worker_web.dart`/`worker_stub.dart`) — Background execution for generation (Isolate/web)
  - `generator/equilibrium.dart` — Adaptive difficulty layer
  - `hint_rank_worker*.dart`, `hint_worker*.dart` — Background workers used by the hint system
  - `utils/groups.dart` — Connected-component / group helpers shared by several constraints
- **`widgets/`** — UI layer: puzzle grid, cell rendering, puzzle selection (`open_page.dart`), puzzle generation (`generate_page.dart`), in-app editor (`create_page/`), settings, stats, help, between-puzzle rating screen. Each constraint has a matching widget (e.g. `widgets/eyes.dart`, `widgets/neighbor_count.dart`).
- **`utils/`** — Platform-conditional sharing (`share_html.dart`/`share_io.dart`/`share_stub.dart`)
- **`l10n/`** — ARB translation files (en, es, fr) and committed generated `app_localizations*.dart`. Configured in `l10n.yaml`. Run `flutter gen-l10n` after editing any `.arb`.

### In-App Puzzle Generator (`lib/getsomepuzzle/generator/`)

The app includes a puzzle generation engine:
- `generator.dart` — `PuzzleGenerator` class: generates puzzles using random grid fill + iterative constraint addition + solve loop. Also includes `findSolutions()` for uniqueness verification via backtracking.
- `worker.dart` and platform implementations — Adaptive background execution: uses `Isolate` on native, chunked async on web.

The `Puzzle` class (`model/puzzle.dart`) includes a full solver: `applyConstraintsPropagation()` (constraint propagation), `applyWithForce()` (forced deduction), `solve()` (combined loop), and `solveWithBacktracking()` (MRV backtracking). A shared `_applyLoop()` method is used by both the UI hint system (`applyAll()`) and the solver.

Generated puzzles are stored in a "custom" collection at `ApplicationDocumentsDirectory/getsomepuzzle/custom.txt` (or `SharedPreferences` on web).

Per-constraint design notes live in `docs/dev/` (e.g. `EyesConstraint.md`, `neighbor_count.md`, `column_count.md`, `group_count.md`, `equilibrium.md`).

### Dart CLI (`bin/generate.dart`)

Command-line tool for batch puzzle operations (pure Dart, no Flutter dependency):
- Generate puzzles: `dart run bin/generate.dart -n 100 -o puzzles.txt`
- Validate puzzles: `dart run bin/generate.dart --check assets/default.txt`
- Sort by difficulty: `dart run bin/generate.dart --read-stats <stats_dir>`

### Puzzle Data Format

Puzzles are stored as single-line text in `assets/default.txt` (~5000 puzzles):
```
v2_12_4x7_2210000010000000212100200100_FM:12.21;PA:25.top;GS:1.2...
```
Fields: version, domain, dimensions, cell state, constraint definitions.

## Key Conventions

- Linting uses `flutter_lints` with `avoid_print` disabled (see `analysis_options.yaml`)
- State management is via StatefulWidget (`setState`) — no external state management library
- CI is GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — manual trigger, builds APK/Windows/Web

## Coding Rules

- **Always run `dart format` after modifying Dart files**

## Constraint invariants

When adding or modifying a `Constraint` subclass in
`lib/getsomepuzzle/constraints/`:

- **`verify(puzzle)`** returns `false` **exactly** when the current state
  already violates the constraint — either directly (broken *now*) or by
  making future satisfaction unreachable. An incomplete-but-still-reachable
  state returns `true`. Do not import `apply()`-flavoured forcing conditions
  (e.g. `have + free == target`) into `verify`: those are deduction
  conditions, not violation conditions.
- **`apply(puzzle)`** may be more aggressive than `verify` about forcing
  cells. It returns a `Move` or `Move(..., isImpossible: this)` on
  contradiction. It must not report a cell value that the current state
  already contradicts.
- **`isCompleteFor(puzzle)`** is the grayout signal: return `true` only
  when no future play can ever make `apply` fire again.
- Every new constraint needs paired regression tests: a reachable-but-
  incomplete state → `verify == true`, an unreachable-but-incomplete state
  → `verify == false`. See `NeighborCountConstraint.verify` in
  `test/constraints_test.dart` for a minimal template.

## Testing Guidelines

- Each test must be **necessary** (not a duplicate of another test), **clear** (title and code match exactly), and **well commented** (explain what is being tested and why)
- Do not create temporary files to immediately read them back — test the logic directly
- Do not add boilerplate around already-tested functions — if `countSolutions` is tested in one file, don't retest it in another
- Prefer testing edge cases and real-world bugs over happy paths that are already covered
- Tests verify intent, not just behaviour
- Tests must encode why behaviour matters, not just what it does.
- A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.
