The **symmetry** rule is represented with bars.

It means that the cell must be part of a symmetrical group.

The direction of the bar is the symmetry axis.

The symmetry cannot extend past the borders of the puzzle.

----

Remember that a **group** contains all the cell of the **same color** that are **orthogonally** connected.
