# Get Some Puzzles

In this game, your aim is to color the cells of the grid in black or white.

To know which cell has to be which color, you have to follow some constraints (rules are explained bellow).

Click (or touch on mobile) a cell to change its color.

Some cells can be already filled and you won't be able to change them, they are indicated by a thin inside border.

You will not be shown when you make a mistake but when the grid is filled, your solution is checked. If you won, another puzzle will start immediately. If you made a mistake, the corresponding constraint will be highlighted and you will be able to change your solution.

If you are stuck, the trashcan icon resets the puzzle to its initial state.

While playing, your timing is recorded (see the Stats section below). If needed, the game can be paused and resumed.

There are about 5k puzzles bundled within the app. Each time you run the app, the collection is shuffled and you get random puzzles. The puzzles you already solved won't show up anymore, you'll see the your progress bellow the puzzle.

## Constraints

### Forbidden pattern

If you see a pattern above the puzzles that has a purple background, you must fill your grid so that this pattern does NOT appear anywhere.

### Group size

If a cell contains a number, it must be part of a group of orthogonally adjacent cells of the same color and that group's size much match the number.

### Parity

If you see an arrow in a cell, there must be the same number of black and white cells in the direction face by the arrow. A cell can contain a double-headed arrow, this means that both sides of the cell must respect the parity rule.

### Letter group

Cells containing the same letter should be part of the same group. A group must not contain different letters.

### Quantity

A black or white number over the puzzle, on a blue background indicates that the total number of cells of that color should match that number.

## Stats

The game records how many time has passed before a puzzle is solve and how many failures were made. This data is NOT collected automatically but if you solve a bunch of puzzles I hope you will send me your stats, I intend to sort the puzzles by difficulty and this would help a lot.

To send the stats, click the "Journal" icon on the main page, to the left of the help icon, copy the content and send it to me.

> Thank you very much.
